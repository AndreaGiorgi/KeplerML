# Machine Learning Project: Predicting habitable exoplanets

Introduction
------------

Purpose of this project was to process data produced by NASA's Kepler mission about exoplanets, build machine learning model using the planetary and stellar features of both potentially habitable and non habitable exoplanets. This trained model could then be used to predict habitability of exoplanets on new data. [Misra17]
