# Machine Learning Project: Predicting habitable exoplanets

This project aims to show how machine learning could speed up exolpanets detection using NASA's Kepler data as starting base. 

Introduction
------------

Purpose of this project was to process data produced by NASA's Kepler mission about exoplanets, build machine learning model using the planetary and stellar features of both potentially habitable and non habitable exoplanets. This trained model could then be used to predict habitability of exoplanets on new data. [Misra17]
